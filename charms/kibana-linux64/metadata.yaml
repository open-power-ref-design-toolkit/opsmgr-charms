  Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to
  work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with
  data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data
  analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps.

  Kibana makes it easy to understand large volumes of data. Its simple,
  browser-based interface enables you to quickly create and share dynamic
  dashboards that display changes to Elasticsearch queries in real time.

  This charm is useful when a version of kibana is not available
  for your platform when using apt install (ppc64el for example)
