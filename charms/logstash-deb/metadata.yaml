  Logstash is a data pipeline that helps you process logs and other event data
  from a variety of systems. With 200 plugins and counting, Logstash can
  connect to a variety of sources and stream data at scale to a central
  analytics system.
  This charm is useful when a version of logstash is not available
  for your platform when using apt install (ppc64el for example)
